## MATLAB Workshops
**[Computational Science and Engineering](http://cse.illinois.edu/)**

### Foreword

MATLAB is a powerhouse language ubiquitous in engineering applications in academia and industry.  This workshop series will introduce you to basic and advanced MATLAB modules and concepts, including a focus on data processing and data analytics workflows.

The EWS Linux machines have everything we need for the workshop.  If you plan to use your personal laptop, you'll need to install a version of MATLAB from MathWorks.


### Location

All workshops will be held in the EWS computer laboratory, [1001](http://ada.fs.illinois.edu/0029Plan1.html) [Mechanical Engineering Laboratory](http://ada.fs.illinois.edu/0029.html).

**There is no sign-up for this series—walk-ins are welcome and encouraged!**


### Topics

#### MATLAB Basics

**Feb. 22, 1:00 p.m.–3:00 p.m.**
